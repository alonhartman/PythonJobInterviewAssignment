Hi Alon,

I would like to give you a home assignment in order to test your self-learning & programming skills

Here it is:

All should be implemented in Python

1.implement in Python a function that downloads the following .json file from a storage server (s3)  to your local machine. Save it to your machine as ‘einat_world_bank.json'
url: http://a360ci.s3.amazonaws.com/Jmx/einat_world_bank.json

2. Implement in Python a function that reads the einat_world_bank.json file from your local machine  and check/validate that the file contain the following value:  090224b0817be218_1_0

3. Implement in Python and Selenium (any kind of Selenium framework) an E2E / UI automation program that simulate real user and do the following:
A. Open a web browser (any web browser type – Chrome/Firefox you choice)
B. go to url: http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/
C. add into the main text field all the text from the ‘einat_world_bank.json’ file.
D. Click on the ‘Format’ button on the upper toolbar.
E. validate that the web browser contains the value ‘090224b0817be218_1_0’
F. Click on the ‘viewer’ button(tab)
G. clicking on the viewer button should cause to an error message with the following text ‘Invalid JSON variable’.    Your task is that the script will check that the system raised this error message (it is the expected behaviour)
